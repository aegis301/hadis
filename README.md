# Hadis

The open access hospital acquired data integration system. Record the data you get, do get the data you need.

This is an open source project using Django to develop a freely accessible data integration system for hospitals. Data recording should be easy, fast and independend from your hospital information system. You should have full control on your data and it should be accessible. HADIS helps you achieve this.

This project is still under development and not ready for production yet! Feel free to contribute though!
