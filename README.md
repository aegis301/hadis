# Hadis

The open access hospital acquired data integration system. Record the data you get, do get the data you need.

This is an open source project using Django to develop a freely accessible data integration system for hospitals. Data recording should be easy, fast and independend from your hospital information system. The plan is to deploy HADIS via docker onto any local server that is able to do it and then be accessible through the hospitals intranet. That way hospitals take control of their data themselves and security is granted by your local IT department. You should have full control on your data and it should be accessible. HADIS helps you achieve this.

This project is still under development and not ready for production yet! Feel free to contribute though!

### Tech in Use
This project is mostly done in the Python webframework called Django. React integration is one of the goals I plan to integrate in the future.

### Todos
Here is the stuff I will need help on and a perfect chance for you to contribute:
* Security - Harden the app against outside attacks (I'm just a script kiddo)
* Data Extraction - Develop a GUI to extract data from the App (Will work on this pretty soon myself)
* UI/UX - Rework the UI and UX - I'm definately not an expert on design (as you will likely see)
